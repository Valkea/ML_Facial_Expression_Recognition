## Summary

This project is the Capstone project for the ML-bookcamp (with Alexey Grigorev).
The goal is to gather some experience in various steps of ML pipeline.

I selected the FER2013 data in order to try solving a `Facial Expression Recognition` problem.
Such a problem is interesting because it tries to classify isolated faces among several expressions (7 on this FER2013 dataset).
